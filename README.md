# 🚘 MotorMitra – Automobile eCommerce Web Application

MotorMitra is an automobile eCommerce web application built to simulate real-world seller and customer workflows such as product browsing, cart management, and checkout flows.

This project went through multiple development phases and reflects the evolution of my full-stack learning journey.

## 🧩 Project Evolution

### Phase 1 – Frontend & API Integration  
The initial version of MotorMitra was developed during an internship, where I focused on:
- Building responsive UI components in React
- Integrating backend APIs
- Working with real-world product and customer data
- Understanding production-level frontend workflows

### Phase 2 – Full-Stack Rebuild  
To gain end-to-end ownership, the project was later rebuilt independently using **Supabase** for:
- Authentication
- Database management
- API handling  

This phase focused on understanding full-stack architecture and product-level decision making.
