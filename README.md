# 🚘 MotorMitra – Automobile eCommerce Web Application

MotorMitra is an automobile eCommerce web application built to simulate real-world seller and customer workflows such as product browsing, cart management, and checkout flows.

This project went through multiple development phases and reflects the evolution of my approach to building full-stack web applications.

## 🧩 Project Evolution

### Phase 1 – Frontend & API Integration  
The initial version of MotorMitra was developed during an internship, where I focused on:
- Building responsive UI components using React
- Integrating backend APIs provided by the company
- Working with real-world product and customer data
- Understanding production-level frontend workflows

### Phase 2 – Full-Stack Rebuild  
To gain end-to-end ownership, the project was later rebuilt independently using **Supabase** as a managed backend for:
- Authentication
- Database management
- API handling  

This phase focused on understanding full-stack architecture, backend integration, and product-level decision making.
